# Best Practices

> ### Use structured outputs
>
> Always validate tool parameters using schemas like Zod to ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors.

> ### Implement proper error handling
>
> Wrap tool executions in try-catch blocks and provide meaningful error messages back to the agent so it can recover gracefully.

> ### Optimize token usage
>
> Keep conversation history manageable by summarizing or truncating old messages. This reduces costs and improves response times.

> ### Monitor and log interactions
>
> Track agent behavior, tool usage, and success rates to identify areas for improvement and debug issues.
